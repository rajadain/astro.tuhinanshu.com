As part of [the recent Spring Onsite](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/element84_last-week-our-e84-team-had-a-chance-to-get-activity-7175601379275632640-Gvfh) at [Element 84](https://element84.com/), I gave this lightning talk on my coding font journey.

Let's start with prehistory, before I even started coding.

I've been playing with computers since I was 2 years old. The very first monospace font I can remember seeing is in WordStar in MS-DOS on an IBM 286 in the very early '90s. As far as I can tell, this font is named **Code Page 437**, and the best modern day replica can be found here: https://laemeur.sdf.org/fonts/

My first GUI monospace memory is of **Courier New** in WordPad on Windows 95: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/courier-new

And of course we all remember **Lucida Console** from Windows XP's blue screen of death: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/lucida-console

After some QBasic as a child in which I wasn't particularly interested, my first real introduction to programming was in high school with Visual Basic 6 and Oracle SQL.

I remember VB6 using **Courier New** again, but this time rendering much better than WordPad in Windows 95: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/courier-new

With Windows Vista we got **Consolas**, which was absolutely stellar. It was thicker but very clear, came with proper italics, and looked great on Windows' unique aliasing. It remains one of the best fonts of all time. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/consolas

When working on PHP code in Linux systems, I would sometimes encounter **Bitstream Vera Sans Mono**, and its later offshoot **DejaVu Sans Mono**, which had their own charm. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Vera

Here's a sample slide of **DejaVu Sans Mono**, which is recognizable by the curvey lowercase `l` and the dotted `0`. https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/

And then, just for a brief period, I was really into the geometric forms of **Envy Code R** for inexplicable reasons. Paired really well with Notepad++ in Windows 7. https://damieng.com/blog/2008/05/26/envy-code-r-preview-7-coding-font-released/

Alright, now I've been doing this for a while, I've seen enough fonts to start to develop a taste.
