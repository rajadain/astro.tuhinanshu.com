> A close friend&#39;s father suddenly passed away today. Death puts so much of life&#39;s frivolity and triviality into perspective.

> We have an innate sense of presence of the people we love, no matter how far away they may be, or how long it&#39;s been since we met them.

> To have it snuffed so suddenly and unexpectedly takes a great toll. To come out of that grief and mourning takes a great time.

> Things will never be the same again, but that doesn&#39;t mean they will never be good again. Realizing this can take years. I&#39;ve seen it.

> Stages of grief are denial, anger, negotiation, depression, acceptance. Each stage takes exponentially longer than the last.

> You can rationalize it, talk about it, empathize with people. But living it is different. You have to find your own way through it.
> 
> &mdash; Terence Tuhinanshu (@rajadain) [May 5, 2015](https://twitter.com/rajadain/status/595383327235923968)

> But know that there is a way through it. The people you love may not be with us, but they are not gone either. They live inside you.

> To love is to know someone. Ask yourself, what would he say? And you will hear his voice and counsel and love because he is in you.

> For we are not truly dead as long as those remain who remember us. Remembering is at once the greatest tribute and best lenitive.

> You&#39;re never truly prepared to lose a parent. Being in your mid 20&#39;s makes it all the more tragic. It is heartbreaking and unfair.
> 
> &mdash; Terence Tuhinanshu (@rajadain) [May 5, 2015](https://twitter.com/rajadain/status/595385031050264576)

> What hurts most is the inability to share all the amazing things you&#39;re going to do in your life with someone who unconditionally loves you.

> Their children&#39;s success is the greatest desire of any parent, and children know this. Now who will cheer for them? Who will care for them?

> That specific void can never be filled, but family and friends come together and pool their love and endure and thrive and prosper and live.

> Goodbye, Uncle. You were a brilliant, charismatic, learned, talented, moral, wise, loving man, and you will be sorely missed &#8211;

> &mdash; Terence Tuhinanshu (@rajadain) [May 5, 2015](https://twitter.com/rajadain/status/595387431291068416)

> &#8211; by those who knew you, and by those who never got a chance to meet you.
