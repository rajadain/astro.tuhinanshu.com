Those that have helped me, taught me and fought me.
Those that have healed me, loved and believed me.
Those that have raised me, cared for and praised me.
Those that have scared me, defied and dared me.

Those that have added, and made me shine brighter.
Those that have taken, yet left me feeling lighter.
Those that have transformed and rearranged what was there,
unearthing what was hidden and is now laid bare.

I am who I am because of all of you.
I am who I am despite your worst and your best.
You are and are not responsible for me.

For a man with no woman in his life,
I sure do have a lot of women in my life.
