I've been exploring street photography, mainly out of my love (or perhaps lust?) for Fuji cameras. However, I cannot justify the expense to myself, be it an X-E4, or the X-T30, or the X-S10, or the coveted X-100v.

To prove to myself that if I do buy an expensive camera, I will actually use it, go out with it and shoot, I decided to use my trusty (and rather dusty) old Panasonic GF5, with a recently purchased second-hand 25mm f1.7 ASPH lens, out in Center City Philadelphia on a balmy Saturday afternoon. Here are the results.
