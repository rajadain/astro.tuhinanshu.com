You see me for what I really am.
With you there is no pretense.
Iâ€™m opened up and laid to bare,
thus revealing all intents.

I cannot refuse my own evil,
as I lie here next to you.
You love me for all my goodness,
and my demons, you love them too.

How can love so pure, so very bright
bring my darkness to the surface?
Yet not balk at the stark contrast,
and not even stop to notice?

You are a puzzle, my dear Catherine,
inexplicable in your simplicity.
And I pray to God that I always protect
you from my corrupt complicity.
