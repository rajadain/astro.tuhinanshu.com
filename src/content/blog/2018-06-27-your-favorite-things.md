Red wine and coffee  
and going to beer gardens.  
Playing with puppies,  
skiing and sky-diving.

Cider in autumn,  
tequila in spring:  
these are a few of  
your favorite things.

Having fresh baguettes  
and blue cheese in Paris.  
Sailing the ocean  
and riding fast horses.

Soccer in summer  
and winter skating:  
these are a few of  
your favorite things.

Scent of sushi,  
taste of a steak.  
Watching Eagles win.  
You love The Eternal Lightness of Being,  
and hip-hop and beach tanning.
