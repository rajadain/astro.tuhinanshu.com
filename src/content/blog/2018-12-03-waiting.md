I’m waiting at the airport
for you to arrive.

As each passenger exits,
I look into their face.
A quick jaunt
from hope to doubt,
from recognition
to the lack thereof,
to disappointment,
to worry.

All in the briefest of moments.

We who wait look to each other,
never saying a word
but silently nodding inside
with a shared appreciation
of this fleeting pathos.

I know you’re coming,
and as soon as you arrive
life kicks into gear,
conversing and commuting.

But until then, I’m waiting.
