Have you ever put, for the second time, shampoo in your hair
because you’re standing in the shower, and that’s what you do there?

How many times have you swiped left and swiped right
as your eyes glazed over, thoughts drifting to the night?

Do you take out your phone to check the time or the weather
only to become lost in Instagram or Twitter?

These idle animations of when the mind checks out
reflect our conditioning to technological clout.

My behavior in these little gaps in between
give me away as a man from twenty seventeen.
