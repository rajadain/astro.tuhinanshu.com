They said you weren’t coming,  
I was told not to wait:  
and make a reservation  
before it was too late.

I really want to see you,  
there is so much to say.  
But my calendar’s all booked  
for the rest of the day.

If only I’d kept me free,  
we’d be together tonight.  
Instead, you’re now leaving  
by an early morning flight.

When will I be able  
to see you like this again?  
I won’t be me, you won’t be you,  
it won’t be now, then.
