> In the past, weâ€™ve seen how we can [generate pyramided tiles from a GeoTiff with GeoTrellis](/posts/generating-pyramided-tiles-from-a-geotiff-using-geotrellis). This month I learned how to do that with GDAL, using `gdal2tiles.py` from the May 2020 release of GDAL 3.1.

This blog post presents a tutorial for generating pyramided map tiles (also called Slippy Map tiles) from a GeoTIFF using GDAL, which can be used in Leaflet or OpenLayers.
