A fish, a fig, a cinnamon stick,  
and half a jar of jam.  
With sourdough buns and American cheese  
and thirteen slices of ham.

A carton of milk that could be bad  
and pepperjack that’s now blue.  
An apple, a pear, a gummy bear,  
and a bottle of used up glue.

A liquid vat of ice cream  
crowds the once vegetable drawer.  
There’s M&M’s, KitKats, and aspirin.  
And candy corn stuck to the floor.

And chili, made days ago,  
with every intention of not letting it waste,  
is stored in a wide-brimmed lidless cup,  
and now everything permeates its taste.

What can you compose, o Maestro,  
thou blessed with divine edict?  
Oh I’ll use it all, and then weep,  
for after cooking I must eat it.

### Origin

The prompt for this writing night was inspired by an old Reddit thread where someone would claim a superpower, and the next comment would come up with its kryptonite, or constrain it in some way to negate it. This is similar to [The Monkey’s Paw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey%27s_Paw) idea, where the use of power has a cost to it. One of my favorite representations of this is in the anime [Darker than Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darker_than_Black), where the use of a power must come with some compulsive behavior by the user to meet its price.

My friend [Jenny Fung](https://hellojfung.com) gave me the superpower prompt to write against: “My super power is being able to use up everything in the refrigerator to make a meal”, and I wrote this as a funny poem about having to eat whatever you cook.

### Prompt

The featured image was generated using OpenAI’s DALL-E 2, with the prompt:

> a Dr Seuss like illustration of an open fridge with fish, jam, milk, bread, cheese, and ice cream in it
