Loving a city is different from loving a woman.

A city does not judge you, has room for all sorts.
Not all of its corners are safe, but some are yours.
The city will love you fairly, honestly, openly.
Your love will never encompass her entirety.
Your love may be strong, but the city is stronger.
The city will always outlive your love for it.

Actually, loving a city is exactly like loving a woman.
