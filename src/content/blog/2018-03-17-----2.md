A hover, a click, a double tap,
an information highway to hell.
How did the lovers of fore resist
a glance, a kiss, a touch or tap,
none remain to ask or to tell.

The times they are a-changing,
and the models of old are gone.
Every man must now stumble along
unaided, unloved, rearranging
himself while carrying on.

To resist anything but temptation
is easier said than done.
But when indulgence comes at a cost
and in a moment, devastation,
whatâ€™s lost is truly won.

So smile, consume, indulge
in fine frivolity and distraction.
Get over, get under, get out
so you never have to divulge
this pitiable, petty infraction.
