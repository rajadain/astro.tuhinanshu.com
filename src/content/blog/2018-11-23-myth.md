To live a life of truth one must
make good friends and earn their trust,
care and help and love and heal,
fill one’s heart with zest and zeal.

Find the thing that’s right to do,
make a plan and follow through.
Do not balk at those in need:
help the fallen to their feet.

Focus on the task at hand.
Be prepared to make a stand.
Do not lust for fame or fans —
the myth comes later, first the man.
