Your dazzling flame draws me ever closer,  
the gravity pulling me around.  
As my moon circles your planet,  
I fall without ever touching ground.

All else I can charm, seduce, and beguile,  
but you never let me in that role.  
With you I’m a helpless, quivering mess:  
you’re a tuning fork for my soul.

Your voice is heady, your words sublime,  
your very presence an intoxication.  
I barely stay balanced, attempting to conceal  
the extent of my sheer fixation.

You bring out my ego, my raw, true self,  
I revel in you revealing me to me.  
I am but a witness of your glorious being,  
a revelation for the world to see.
