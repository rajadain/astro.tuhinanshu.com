I did to her  
as was done to me  
and now we’re broken free.

A historic replay  
with three year’s delay  
to the same day in February.

Having seen  
both sides now,  
I know how she feels and felt.

A little older,  
a little wiser,  
a little less innocent.

“No pain, no gain!”  
Love is lost in the noise  
of the ‘gram, FOMO and YOLO.

We’re all just dealing  
with the paradox of choice  
and will likely remain solo.
