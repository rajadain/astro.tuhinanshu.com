Though love may come every once in a while,
with tears of sadness and the happiness of smiles,

Though anger strike in a flash of lightning,
or the apathy of despair, or fear of frightening,

Each emotion swells and ebbs with the flow,
coming when destined, until its time to go.

The one constant that stays at the end of days,
my loneliness alone never strays or betrays.
