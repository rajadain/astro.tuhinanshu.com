I have had a number of publishing platforms over the years, this being at least the sixth, by my best count.

There is romance and excitement whenever beginning a new site, just as a new notebook. I can almost smell it. "What will I write here," I wonder. "What pearls of wisdom shall manifest themselves, evoked both gently and violently from the gaping maw of possibility that is the empty prompt?" (to be read in the self-aware, self-aggrandizing, and self-mocking tone of Dr. Frasier Crane) And then you write something, and it's not quite what you thought, and writing is hard, and why would one write at all when there's so much to read, and even more to watch, and even more to play, and even more to converse about? Thus it goes, that another site [falls to the wayside](https://rajadain.github.io/daily-verse/), [neglected](__GHOST_URL__/), [ignored](https://tuhinanshu.blogspot.com/), [forgotten](https://anterence.blogspot.com/), [lost](http://tuhinanshu.posterous.com/).

It is not inspiration, but discipline that keeps a site going. The more effort it takes to write, the easier it is to abandon. Once the old WordPress instance got hacked, it was easier to take it all down and leave up a static scrape, until a newer platform could be setup again. Which bring us here, using Ghost, which I've wanted to explore for at least five years.

The best content from the previous generations will be ported into this site. The rest can be accessed via the links categorized below, for as long as they are online.

### Prior Writings

- [https://rajadain.github.io/daily-verse/](https://rajadain.github.io/daily-verse/): The Daily Verse project, which will remain my primary poetic journal. The entries there are far from daily now, but I do not consider the site abandoned. For additional insight into the poems, take a look at the [commit messages](https://github.com/rajadain/daily-verse/commits/gh-pages).
- [http://blog.tuhinanshu.com/](__GHOST_URL__/): The previous WordPress blog. Got hacked a few years ago, so I took down the actual instance. I had started working on making a static scrape of the site that could be hosted on Netlify. That work never finished, but in whatever state it was, is what remains today.
- [https://tuhinanshu.blogspot.com/](https://tuhinanshu.blogspot.com/): A Blogspot for long-form writing. Contains two entries: a paper written for a Drexel course, and a note on the then-state of webfonts. We've come a long way.
- [https://anterence.blogspot.com/](https://anterence.blogspot.com/): Another Drexel course based Blogspot, which started out as logging activity in the course, but then was a place to share snippets and small code discoveries.
- [http://tuhinanshu.posterous.com/](http://tuhinanshu.posterous.com/): I have no memory of this, and no idea what was there. But it's gone forever, so we may never know.
