An entire lifetime captured in a breath:
from supine to standing, from birth till death.

As I move forward from pose to pose
I feel the flow of water, the tangling of rose.

Momentarily my focus wavers,
pulling me to the present.
Then Iâ€™m back, and all time is one,
from sun to waning crescent.

Everyday struggles will soon be conquered:
they cause me no more pain.
Just like cat and cow, serpent and crow,
crocodile, monkey, and crane.
