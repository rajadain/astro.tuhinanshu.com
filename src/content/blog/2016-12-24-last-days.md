If all I had was a year to live,
I’d travel the world, a heart adrift.

When only a handful months remain,
I’ll code and write, sketch and paint.

I’ll feast in my final fortnight
on favorite foods and sweet delights.

I’ll save a few concluding days
for admiring nature’s wonderous ways.

And in my last remaining hour or two,
I’ll sit back, relax, and think of you.
