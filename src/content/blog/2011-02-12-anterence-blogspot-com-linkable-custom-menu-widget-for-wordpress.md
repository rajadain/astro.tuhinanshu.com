I'm working on several Wordpress based projects, including [Omescribe](http://omescribe.com/), which is one of a family of sites including [Omenad](http://omenad.net/) and [Madhukali](http://madhukali.org/blog). Because these sites are related, I wanted them to fetch the latest posts from each other. Madhukali is running on Wordpress, so I used the [RSS Feed Widget](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-rss-feeds-widget/) to fetch its posts. Omenad, however, is still an old site with individual HTML pages. I wanted to create a menu that led to Omenad and its salient sections, namely [Articles](http://omenad.net/base_art.htm), [Queries](http://omenad.net/base_queries.htm), [Raga Rang](http://omenad.net/base_ragrang.htm) and [In My View](http://omenad.net/base_theories.htm#inmyview). This was also easily accomplished with the Custom Menu Widget. But I wanted to have the title link to Omenad.

After much searching, I found [this widget by PepLamb](http://peplamb.com/linkable-title-html-and-php-widget/) that guided me into creating [my own](http://omescribe.com/ter/linked-custom-menu.zip). This super simple widget just adds two options: Title URL and Open in New Window, which you can set for any menu, as shown in the screenshot.

(Click for larger version.)

Of course the CSS can be edited to adjust the hyperlink coloring, but I like it like this. You can download the plugin here: [linked-custom-menu.zip](http://omescribe.com/ter/linked-custom-menu.zip).
