> Our identities belong permanently to the conceptual world. They can&#8217;t be seen, heard, smelled, touched or tasted. They&#8217;re merely ideas. And everything else — at the start — belongs to the sensual world, the world outside us.

> Gradually we reach beyond ourselves.

> We encounter the sight, smell, touch, taste and sound of our own bodies.
> 
> And of the world around us.

> And we discover that objects of the physical world can also cross over —

### Background

The book is filled with many such gems, reproduced poorly here without their accompanying illustrations. I feature this one now because of the final line: *the life we lend to them*. This plays neatly into a pet philosophy of the world I developed when I was in the eighth grade, still a few years before I would get my hands on this book. Even though I&#8217;ve grown out of those ideas, I might get around to publishing them here, and thus this serves as foreshadowing.
