Isnâ€™t it pathetic that
in my moment of weakness,
of doubt,
when I am brought to question
the fundamentals of my own identity,
I seek the one I hurt,
who rejected and left me,
and find solace in the beauty
that she creates,
that she embodies,
that she exudes,
and it is through my ability
to recognize that beauty,
to love her still,
that I am brought back
to myself,
to calm,
to peace,
to grace.
