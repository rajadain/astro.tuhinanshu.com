Twelve years I waited passively for inspiration to strike at will:  
sometimes it flowed like honey, sometimes like viscous swill.

Inspiration is everywhere, you see: one only has to notice.  
If not outside then look within: life comes into focus.

From that image you can reflect, observe and reimagine,  
draw grand ideas, lofty goals, or small details examine.

In search of my Active Voice, I begin this daily chore.  
I know not where it leads to, but soon we’ll find out more.
