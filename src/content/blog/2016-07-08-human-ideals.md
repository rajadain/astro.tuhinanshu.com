The ideal man is calm, capable, tolerant,
and takes responsibility for his actions,
both direct and indirect.

The ideal woman is kind, caring, patient,
and forgiving of flaws,
both in herself and in those around her.

Together, with their compassion and understanding,
they heal the world, and nurture a better one.
