A set of tweets about how the Sandboxing model of Windows 8 Metro / Modern apps, designed for safety of tablets, is limiting their potential for the Desktop.

> I think that excluding Metro / Modern apps from Desktop is an ill mindset to have for today&#39;s Windows developers [#Win8Apps](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Win8Apps?src=hash)

> And equally ill mindset for Microsoft who develops the platform. I understand their One Windows vision, and that&#39;s great [#Win8Apps](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Win8Apps?src=hash)

> Because of WinRT sandboxing which makes sense (or does it?) for tablets, the WinRT apps for Desktop are feeble and useless [#Win8Apps](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Win8Apps?src=hash)

> Modern apps for Desktop should be akin (somewhat) to the fullscreen apps in OS X that one can swipe through. The gesture is there [#Win8Apps](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Win8Apps?src=hash)

> And [#Win8Apps](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Win8Apps?src=hash) have the added advantage of having 0 chrome: only content. Big, beautiful content! I&#39;d love to have a shell and a browser open
