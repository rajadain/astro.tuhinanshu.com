I flow,

Free, fluid, fervent, fleeting,

Floating through forests, grasslands, and hills.

You try and use my

Form for you function —

For you farms, for your cargo,

Your wars, your waste, and your dead.

Go ahead.

I accept all materials of the Earth,

Yet am tainted by none.

And even as my body

Acts as a conduit for the World,

My Spirit is Free.

~ Terence Tuhinanshu

### Origin

Some ineffable inspiration from a dear poet friend, whose bravery in the face of harshness, and commitment to all that is good and right in the world is as compelling as it is enthralling.

I also wanted to further experiment with combining lettering and poetry, and try more visually expressive poems, such as [H. Masud Taj](http://www.treereadingseries.ca/readers/masud-taj)&#8216;s The Bat. Unfortunately I am unable to find that poem online, and the book that features it is in India, but by altering the lengths of each line, the poem draws out the shape of a bat, in addition to being about a bat, and called The Bat. I don&#8217;t remember when I saw it (probably in the early to mid 2000&#8217;s), but I remember being very impressed by it, and the idea of visual-semantic mirroring stuck.

### Commentary

This is not the best execution of the strategy of visual-semantic mirroring, which I&#8217;m sure takes a great deal of thought, revision and iteration to achieve. This poem does not really look like a waterfall. This was spontaneous, done in one continuous flow, much like most of my poetry. There are a few edits, and these have been added to the text in this post. Specifically, the phrase &#8216;Your wars&#8217; was added to the last line of the second para, and &#8216;touched&#8217; has been replaced by &#8216;tainted&#8217; in the fourth.
