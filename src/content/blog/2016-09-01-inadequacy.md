How does one deal with one&#8217;s own inadequacy?

With true lack of merit, of talent, of acuity?

What do you do when it is shown plainly to you

that you&#8217;re not worth anything of real value?

How do you feel when even after enough chances

you&#8217;ve consistently failed at making advances?

It&#8217;s clear that life is not being unfair here:

you genuinely suck in every possible sphere.

So just shut up and accept that you&#8217;ll never win,

never feel soaring success or happiness within.

What you&#8217;re best at is being a loser by far.

You live in a studio, can&#8217;t even drive a car.

You yell at friends and wallow in self-pity.

You reek of sadness, and you&#8217;re not even pretty.

It&#8217;s not the universe, destiny, karma or fate

that stops you from finishing even one poem straight.

It&#8217;s all you, my friend, it always has been.

The awkwardness, stupidity, amentia and cringe.

So just stop trying to find an answer or excuse

for why you&#8217;re being treated like repulsive refuse.

It&#8217;s because you deserve it, you really do.

And that&#8217;s all there is to it, so now we&#8217;re through.
