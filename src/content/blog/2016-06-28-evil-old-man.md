Of all the things I’d thought I’d be,  
this was never one.  
A bitter, lonely, husk of a man  
completely spent and done.

Unable to see, hear or speak,  
my body failing me.  
But what pains me more are the changes in  
my own personality.

Is it not enough that I suffer  
for all the sins I’ve done?  
Must I also suffer the misery  
of hurting everyone?

I don’t know what I hate more —  
the monster I’ve become,  
or everyone else for letting me live so long  
till I’m nothing but rotten scum.
