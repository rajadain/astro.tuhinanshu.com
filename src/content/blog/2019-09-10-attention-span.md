Get more sleep, exercise.  
A side of salad, not the fries.  
Read a book, feed the soul.  
Don’t fall into a Reddit hole.

Go outside, climb a hill.  
Enough of solo Netflix & chill.  
Be in nature, smell the flowers.  
Stop YouTube after three hours.

Listen to people, call your gran.  
Stop staring at girls on Instagram.  
I’d make things better with this plan,  
if only I had the attention span.
