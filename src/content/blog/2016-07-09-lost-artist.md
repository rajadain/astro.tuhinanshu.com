They let me paint, so I painted.
They told me to write, so I wrote.
They taught me patience, so I waited
till they left, and painted this note.

They taught me to be
the very best I can be
but my best might not be enough.

Without you I just wander
and ponder and wonder
how a life so fine feels so rough.
