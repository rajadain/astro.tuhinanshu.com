Drop by drop and bit by bit
I’ve poured my life into you.
I have little left for myself
and that little is yours too.

To see you smile, or calmly sleep
is the greatest gift I’ve got.
There is no me without you now,
its you I’d always sought.

I dabbled in love, played with romance,
thought to one day meet someone.
But they all pale in comparison
to you, my beautiful son.
