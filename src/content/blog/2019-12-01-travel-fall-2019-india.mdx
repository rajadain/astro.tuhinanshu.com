A recap of my travels in India in November 2019. I was there with my friends David and Teagan for three weeks, and it was a trip of a lifetime. Every day we did something for the first time in our lives. We started in Mumbai, and covered Indore, Dhar, Mandu, Khajuraho, Bhopal, Sanchi, Bhim Betka, Jaipur, and New Delhi. We saw artifacts ranging from 100 to 6000 years old. It was a trip of a lifetime. I'm eternally grateful to my parents for organizing and facilitating it.
