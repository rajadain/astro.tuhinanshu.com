> There's no escaping reason, no evading purpose, because we both know, that without purpose there is no reason to exist. It is purpose that created us, purpose that connects us, purpose that pulls us, that guides us, that drives us, that defines us, it is purpose that binds us.

The purpose of this blog is to serve as a journal during my first time experience in the Open Source Software Development (OSSD) world. During the 6-7 week period, I will be trying to get myself involved to some notable degree with the development of the [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) project together with my colleagues [James Chy](http://jimchy.blogspot.com/) and [Sam Gammon](http://atom--ant.blogspot.com/).
