Naturally bitter,
artificially sweet.
A warm, welcoming,
intoxicating treat.

Mysteriously dark, yet
familiar and friendly.
Liquid and solid,
gooey and deadly.

An indulgence for the happy,
a consolation for the sad.
An accelerant of passion;
aphrodisiac for the mad.

A pleasure without guilt,
a substance without abuse.
No, I’m not addicted.
Yes, I’ll have that mousse.
