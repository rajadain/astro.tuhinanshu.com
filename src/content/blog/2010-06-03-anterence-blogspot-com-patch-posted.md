Just posted my patch into Ant. You can see it [here](https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16131).

Turns out that posting a patch (the `svn diff` thing) was highly recommended, as when I was submitting it they asked whether or not the attachment was a patch. If not, they would then autodetect the file and try to figure it out from there. I know that I would pay less attention to a non-patch patch, and sympathize with the poor core members who have to deal with all this stuff.

Speaking of core members, upon successful submission I was given the message:

Email sent to:

`notifications-@ant.apache.org`, `nils-@meiers.net`, `mccartney-@mayaviz.com`, `eric-@timebytes.com`, `jakob.voss-@gbv.de`

Excluding:

no one

This probably means that I'll be hearing from one of them soon. Our Professor said that when a patch is submitted there is usually a back and forth conversation, almost a negotiation, which occurs between the reviewers (core) and the submitter (periphery)(me).
