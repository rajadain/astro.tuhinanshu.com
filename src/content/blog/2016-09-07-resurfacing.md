“Can you breathe?” the man said.  
“Yes, I think so,” I replied.  
“You’re okay, it’s gonna be alright.”  
He made my panic subside.

Once back on land, I realized  
the man was me, inside my mind.  
In the moment when I was almost lost  
I found calmness of the warmest kind.

Trusting my capable instincts  
is a gift of the highest order.  
I trust my man will resurface  
at every perilous border.
