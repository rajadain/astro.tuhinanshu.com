Is the painter proud as she moves her brush?  
Or the writer, lost in thought?

Is the soldier proud as he plunges his blade  
in battle more “survived” than “fought”?

Pride comes only with time and distance,  
and mostly to cowards afar.

To the brave, pride in others is pretentious,  
and in themselves a memory’s scar.
