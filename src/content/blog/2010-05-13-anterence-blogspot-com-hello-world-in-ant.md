Am going through a tutorial on Ant:[http://wiki.apache.org/ant/AntTutorialWritingTasks](http://wiki.apache.org/ant/AntTutorialWritingTasks)

My earlier experiences with Ant have been limited to changing a few things in an existing Ant file and pretty much ignoring the rest. This will help me get an understanding of how its supposed to work.

EDIT: That tutorial left something to be desired. Am working on this better one: [http://ant.apache.org/manual/using.html](http://ant.apache.org/manual/using.html)
