> Understanding efficiency gains in a scalable, cloud-native data-processing environment unlocks an array of new possibilities when dealing with large, complex datasets such as the National Water Model. In this article, we take a deep dive into Zarr and Parquet and determine which is more performant on various time scales.

This blog post recaps our research on which popular data format works better for National Water Model access over the cloud.
