I am a poet, thinker, designer, developer, and a citizen of the world.

My primary medium is the web, for which I have been designing and developing front- and back-ends, databases, infrastructure, continuous integration systems, graphics, logos, and fonts privately since 1999, and professionally since 2007. I care about design, beauty, elegance, mathematics, problem solving, systems, and usefulness, and am quite lucky to study and work in a field at the intersection of all of this and more: software engineering. I have an [MS in Software Engineering](https://drexel.edu/cci/academics/masters-programs/ms-in-software-engineering/) from Drexel University where I focused on User Interfaces and Artificial Intelligence, how people think and how machines "think".

I care deeply about the planet, sustainability, climate change, energy efficiency, and water. I have been privileged to work on software projects focused on these climate concerns in various capacities at [PSD Consulting](https://psdconsulting.com) and [Azavea](https://www.azavea.com), and continue to do so in my current roles of Senior Software Engineer at [Element 84](https://element84.com). For a full list of credentials, [find me on LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tuhinanshu) or [download my resume](/resume.pdf).

I come from [a family of music](https://raginitrivedi.com), and have worked on a number of projects at the intersection of technology and Indian Classical Music: [Omenad](https://omenad.net), [Omenad Fonts](http://fonts.omenad.net), [Omescribe](https://omescribe.com), and [Raga Swar](https://twitter.com/ragaswar). I have designed and published [books](https://www.lulu.com/shop/ragini-trivedi/sitar-compositions-in-ome-swarlipi/hardcover/product-1gvq4vgj.html) and [albums](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mGSzOI0AOf0DMqv5x758Ibj6P3XgXEhOU).

I love cities and art museums and [enjoy travel](/tags/travel). I love beauty in all its forms, especially visual. I love films and television and graphic novels and video games. I love being both [in front of](/tags/photoshoot) and [behind a camera](/tags/photography).
